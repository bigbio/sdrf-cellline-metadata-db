- **Be mindful of your language.** Any of the following behavior is unacceptable:

  - Offensive comments related to gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, language, neuro-type, size, ability, class, religion, culture, subculture, political opinion, age, skill level, occupation, or background
  - Threats of violence
  - Deliberate intimidation
  - Sexually explicit or violent material
  - Unwelcome sexual attention
  - Stalking or following
  - Or any other kinds of harassment

Use your best judgement. If it possibly makes others uncomfortable, do not post it.

- **Be respectful.** Disagreement is not an opportunity to attack someone else's thoughts or opinions. Although views may differ, remember to approach every situation with patience and care.
- **Be considerate.** Think about how your contribution will affect others in the community.
- **Be openly minded.** Embrace new people and new ideas. Our community is continually evolving, and we welcome positive change.

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report it by emailing [yperez@ebi.ac.uk](mailto:yperez@ebi.ac.uk). Please include your name and a description of the incident, and we will get back to you ASAP.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the group may take any action, including expulsion from all spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other members or the general public.
